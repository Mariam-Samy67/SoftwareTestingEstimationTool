# Software Testing Estimation Tool

## Description
A simple Java program that demonstrates four popular software testing estimation techniques:
- Ratio-based Estimation
- Extrapolation
- Wideband Delphi
- Three-Point Estimation

It helps testers and project managers estimate testing effort using different approaches.

## Features
- ✅ Ratio Based Estimation → calculates testing effort using past dev:QA ratios
- ✅ Extrapolation → scales up testing time from a small sample
- ✅ Wideband Delphi → averages expert estimates
- ✅ Three-Point Estimation → uses Optimistic, Most Likely, and Pessimistic estimates

## Technologies
- Java
- Methods, Arrays, Loops, Arithmetic Operations

## How to Run
1. Save the file as TestEstimation.java
2. Compile: javac TestEstimation.java
3. Run: java TestEstimation

## Example Output
1️⃣ Ratio Based Estimation: 30.0 hours
2️⃣ Extrapolation: 60.0 hours
3️⃣ Wideband Delphi: 24.2 hours
4️⃣ Three-Point Estimation: 17.0 hours
